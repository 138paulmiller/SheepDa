; Examples of closures, dynamic binding and static scoping

; Defines x to be a closure that accepts one parameter and returns another closure that accepts two parameter
; Calling (x "value") will bind the parameter x to be "value" when evaluating the inner closure, so x => "value"
x = \ x. 
	\ a b .
		(x a b )

; +ing strings to other strings and numbers
(print ((x +) "hello" " world"))
(print ((x +) "hello" 9.88))
(print ((x +) "hello" 9))

; -tracting strings and numbers from strings 
; Works by removing the right -string from the left string
(print ((x -) "hello world!!!" " world"))
(print ((x -) "hello100.98" 100.98))
(print ((x -) "hello100.98" 100))
;(print ((x -) 45 "4")) 	;Will not work! the left expression determines the operation type for artithmetic 

;/ision works similar as an intersection of left and right 
(print ((x /) "Hello World" "el"))
(print ((x -) "Hello World" ""))

;*tiplication works as a star operator
(print ((x *) "Hello World" ""))
(print ((x *) "Hello World" 3))
