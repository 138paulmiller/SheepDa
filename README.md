# SheepDa
### A Soft Functional Scripting Language
Sheepda provides a minimal syntax as a "Soft" introduction to Functional Programming concepts.
Language features closures, dynamic binding, static scoping, and lazy evaluation with a syntax mixture of LISP and Lamba-Calculus. 

#### Usage
See HELP for menu

##### Why?
This project started out as a small language to help programmers quickly understand fundamental functional programming concepts such as first-class functions, immutability and lazy-evaluation. 
I will be spending time adding various features to the language to help it evolve from a toy language into a useful scripting language.

##### Syntax:
	<stmt>	: <id> = <expr>			// Assignment to idetifier
		| <expr>			// Stand-alone Expression
		| ; <sym> ... \n		// Comments, ends at newline
	<expr>	: \ <param_id> <...> . <expr>	// Defines an abstraction
		| (<expr> <expr> <..>)		// Applies erxpressions on the right to the leftmost expression
		| [0-9]+.?[0-9]*		// Integer of Floating point literal
		| [a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9]*		// Identifier
		| "."				// String, anything encapsulated within quotes
